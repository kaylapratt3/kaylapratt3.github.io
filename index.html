    <p><em>“The word is not simply a scribbled symbol or a spoken sound, 
The word is not like a roaring lion that no one really fears, NO. The word has power, And it can be your trusted friend or your most terrible foe,You see like a seed, the word gives life Like a lamp, the word gives light Like a mirror, the word reflects Like water, the word washes
Like fire, the word cleanses  Like hammer, the word shatters Like a sword, the word cuts Oh but like medicine, the word heals And like a councillor, the word comforts you see the word is alive, and it is waiting Waiting for you to summon it like a soldier, and send it into battle So Speak”</em></p>
